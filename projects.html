      <p>During my winter quarter at the University of Washington Bothell, I took a course in Game Design and Development, in which we were able to create a thoroughly planned out game in a group setting. At the beginning of the quarter, we were introduced to our client, the Woodland Park Zoo, whose goal was to find more interactive and engaging forms of educating others about conservation and the issues that animals today are facing in their various environments. It was our job to design a game that would not only be engaging and fun, but also be informational in it’s nature. We started out with countless ideas, ranging from geolocation based mobile games to, what we decided on, a board game. Our concept design evolved a lot from the brainstorming stage to what it is now. Though we weren’t able to get the game into its final stages, we were able to build a solid foundation for it and develop a game that is not only interesting to play, but also teaches the player about the various issues that different animals living in various environments are facing today. Sanctuary is a game meant to spark an interest in current issues in our environment today and encourage the players to learn more about them. </p>
