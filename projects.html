    <div class="column">
      <p>According to the National Institute of Mental Health, Major Depression and anxiety is among the most common mental health disorders in the United States alone. I wanted to create a place where users could not only have a secure place to map their day-to-day activities and mood, but to also communicate with other users and create an engaging and supportive community. This concept originally started for my Web Development class, but eventually grew bigger than a simple course project. I believe it's extremely important to start a conversation about mental health and I want to contribute to this in a positive way and create an environment where users can feel safe and know that they aren't alone in their struggles.</p>

      <p>Another currently ongoing project is a study in absurdist games and introduction to the use Unity and C#. Created in a group based setting, this project required entirely self teaching ourselves Unity and thoroughly researching and understanding the fundamentals of absurdism. Though a seemingly simple and cute game, it's supposed to engage the player in an entirely meaningless struggle, and yet keep them engaged enough to continue playing. Absurdism, at it's core, is understanding that your efforts are meaningless, and yet continuing to do them anyways. Through Tamatrashi, we use the fundamentals of this concept to illustrate the struggles of parenthood and the idea that no matter how much you struggle for your children, despite their being no actual material reward to it, continuing to do it anyways.</p>

      <h3>SANCTUARY: THE BOARD GAME</h3>
		<br/><br/>
      <img src="images/logo.png" alt="" class="profile"> </div>
    <div class="column">
      <p>During my winter quarter at the University of Washington Bothell, I took a course in Game Design and Development, in which we were able to create a thoroughly planned out game in a group setting. At the beginning of the quarter, we were introduced to our client, the Woodland Park Zoo, whose goal was to find more interactive and engaging forms of educating others about conservation and the issues that animals today are facing in their various environments. It was our job to design a game that would not only be engaging and fun, but also be informational in it’s nature. We started out with countless ideas, ranging from geolocation based mobile games to, what we decided on, a board game. Our concept design evolved a lot from the brainstorming stage to what it is now. Though we weren’t able to get the game into its final stages, we were able to build a solid foundation for it and develop a game that is not only interesting to play, but also teaches the player about the various issues that different animals living in various environments are facing today. Sanctuary is a game meant to spark an interest in current issues in our environment today and encourage the players to learn more about them. </p>
